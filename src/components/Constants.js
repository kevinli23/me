    `Whomever is reading this, Hello! I'm currently a second year Computer Science Student at the University of Waterloo. I have been programming for about
    three years and am actively learning new things daily! I am currently employed at Intelex Technologies Inc. where I work as a software developer. At the moment, I am
    interested in Machine Learning (especially the mathematics that goes behind it!) as well as various other JavaScript libraries such as React and Node.`,

    `Aside from programming and learning, on my spare time I enjoy playing basketball (and keeping up with the NBA), watching cooking videos, following politics and
    playing a bit of video games.`,

    `I am currently seeking an internship opportunity for the summer (May to August) of 2020 that involves Software Development or Machine Learning!`,
